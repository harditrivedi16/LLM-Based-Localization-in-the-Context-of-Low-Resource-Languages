*Abstract*: Recent advancements in large language models
(LLMs) have enabled the development of systems capable of
generating human-like responses across a wide range of tasks.
However, research focus has been primarily on high-resource
languages such as English, German, and French, whereas lowresource
languages have not benefited from these advances.
This has created a challenge for localization which requires
multinationals to deploy natural language processing-based tools
across world-wide geographic footprints.
In this paper, we evaluate the state-of-the-art in questionanswering
for several low-resource Indian languages, including
Hindi and Gujarati, and explore a sample Human Resources use
case. We focus on neural machine translation based on transfer
learning, multilingual meta-learning, and zero-shot approaches,
combined with open source LLMs with conversational capabilities.
